<h1>Timer Service Documentation</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

The Timer Service is designed to generate pages that "count down" the time remaining in a session or a set of sessions.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

The Timer Service can be used in One-Off Mode or Conference Mode.

<h3>One-Off Mode</h3>

In One-Off Mode the Timer Service generates a page that counts down the time for a single session (as if it has already started) ending at a specific time.

<h3>Conference Mode</h3>

In order to use the Timer Service in Conference Mode, you will need to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON data file</a> that can be loaded from a URL. Review <a href="http://genteman.org/data/CppNow2018.json">this example file</a>.

<h4>Data File Format</h4>

The JSON file represents an array of sessions. Each session is a dictionary with the following keys:
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Key</th><th>Required?</th><th>Data Type</th><th>Content</th><th>Semantic</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>begin</td><td>required</td><td>string</td><td>data/time in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 format</a></td><td>start time of session in local time</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>end</td><td>optional</td><td>string</td><td>data/time in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 format</a></td><td>end time of session in local time</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>duration</td><td>optional</td><td>integer</td><td>positive values</td><td>duration of session, in minutes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tracks</td><td>optional</td><td>array of strings</td><td>track names</td><td>tracks in which this session should be included</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4>Duration</h4>

If the "end" key is present, the duration is taken to be until that time. Otherwise if the "duration" key is present, the end of the session is calculated using that value. Otherwise the session is assumed to last for one hour.

<h4>Tracks</h4>

A single data file should be adequate for all the requirements of a single conference, even if that conference has multiple tracks with different sessions times.

Any session without a "tracks" key is assumed to be in all tracks. If a "tracks" key is present, then the session is only added to the specified tracks.

<h3>Show Hours</h3>

By default, the time is shown as a number of minutes. Optionally, for times longer than 59 minutes, time can be shown as hours and minutes.

<h3>Show Seconds</h3>

By default, the time is not shown with seconds (until the time remaining is less than ten minutes), but can optionally do so.

<h3>URL</h3>

The Timer service is called in one of these forms:

For Conference Mode:
<pre>
        https://cppform.cierecloud.com/timer/<i>track_name</i>/?url=<i>url_of_data_file</i>&h&s
</pre>

For One-Off Mode:
<pre>
        https://cppform.cierecloud.com/timer/<i>track_name</i>/?end=<i>end_time</i>&h&s
</pre>

where:
<dl>
	<dt><i>track_name</i></dt>
		<dd>is an optional track name</dd>
	<dt><i>url_of_data_file</i></dt>
		<dd>is the URL of the JSON formated file containing the sessions</dd>
	<dt><i>end_time</i></dt>
		<dd>is the end time of the session in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 format</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If <i>track_name</i> is not specified, only sessions without a "tracks" key will be used.</p>

<p>If neither the url nor the end parameter is passed, this file is returned.</p>

<p>If the h parameter is optional and can be expressed as &show_hours.</p>

<p>If the s parameter is optional and can be expressed as &show_seconds.</p>
